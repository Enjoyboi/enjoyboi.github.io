### Overview  
**Campus Careers** is a career development platform created during **ICS 314 Spring 2025**. Designed to help students explore job listings, connect with mentors, and manage their professional presence, this app was built using **Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL**.

The platform allows users to:
- Create and manage professional profiles
- Browse and filter job postings
- Connect with career mentors
- Submit “Contact Us” forms stored in the database
- Filter entries by category or tag
- Access an admin dashboard (admin-only view)

The app was deployed using **Vercel** and backed by a live PostgreSQL database on **Supabase**. Our team followed **Issue-Driven Project Management**, used GitHub Projects for planning, and implemented CI/CD via GitHub Actions and Playwright.

### My Role in the Project  
I contributed to both the **infrastructure** and **feature development** of Campus Careers. My key responsibilities included:

- **Created the project app template** using the Next.js starter setup  
- **Designed the Campus Careers logo**  
- **Implemented authentication** using **NextAuth.js** for secure sign-in and session management  
- **Built the admin dashboard** for managing skills and locations in the database  
- **Connected Prisma to a live Supabase PostgreSQL database**  
- **Added persistence and admin view** for "Contact Us" form submissions  
- **Linked the Contact Us form into the website navigation bar**  
- **Created GitHub Project boards** for **Milestones 1, 2, and 3**, organizing tasks for our team  

In addition, I participated in team debugging sessions, ensured Playwright tests were integrated into our GitHub Actions workflow, and reviewed pull requests to maintain code quality.

### Lessons Learned  
Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:
- Full-stack web development with **Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL**
- **Authentication and access control** using modern libraries like **NextAuth**
- **Admin dashboard design** for real-world content management
- Agile methodologies like **Issue-Driven Project Management**
- Working with production deployments and CI/CD pipelines

I also learned how to support a development team through clear documentation, visual design contributions, and structured project management.
